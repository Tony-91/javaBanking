1. int balance;
2. int previousBalance; 
3. String customerName;

> underneath that, we create our bankAccount constructor with 2 params.

## deposit, withdraw & getPreviousTransaction methods 

Next we create 3 methods that give our application functionaility yo do things.
- deposit(), withdraw() and getPreviousTransaction() are comprised of math equations that fulfill each of their expected functions. 
- Later down the line the `int amount` variable will equal `scan.nextInt()` - the user's next int input.
